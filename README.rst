identipic
=========

*identipic* is a graphical tool to create grids of ID pictures to be printed
on photo paper.

The idea is to reduce the price tag of identity pictures, that can cost up to
â‚¬1 per photograph when made in dedicated photobooths.


Building
--------

This is a C++14 Qt project, usual build instructions apply::

    $ qmake identipic.pro
    $ make -j4


Usage
-----

#. Run the ``identipic`` binary
#. Click *Load image* (``Ctrl-O``) and pick a face picture
#. Choose the right picture and paper sizes according to your location
#. If needed, adjust brightness and contrast using the dedicated sliders
#. You may play with the other settings, but the defaults should work
#. Click *Build* (``Ctrl-S``) to generate the final image

You may want to adjust the ``DPI`` and *Build* again if the output image is
too small or too big.

You can preview the output image in your default image viewer using ``Ctrl-P``.
